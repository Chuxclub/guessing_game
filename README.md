# guessing_game
Computer guesses a user number (algorithm training)

Exercise from Bjarne Stroustrup's book Programming, Principles and Practice Using C++:

Write a program to play a numbers guessing game. The user thinks of a
number between 1 and 100 and your program asks questions to figure out
what the number is (e.g., “Is the number you are thinking of less than
50?”). Your program should be able to identify the number after asking no
more than seven questions. Hint: Use the < and <= operators and the if-
else construct.
